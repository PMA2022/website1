So let's talk about robotics. In my opinion it is the best club to participate in. 

All of my robotics experience revolves around these two teams.

Team 1649: Lakerbotics
This was the first robotics team that I had participated in. 

Team 2848: AllSparks
This is the current robotics team I am in. 




Side by side comparison:
Both teams are fun to participate in, and both coaches are friendly. They both also are somewhat small, so everyone has something to do during the build day.

Its crazy how this image was taken one year ago to date..
